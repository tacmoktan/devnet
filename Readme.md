A small social networking site for developers built with MERN stack.

# To run the fullstack project locally

2. clone this repo **devnet**.
3. Add both of the repos into the same directory, say **Project**.
4. Go to **Project** directory on command line then:  
    ```
    cd devnet-api
    npm run dev
    ```
